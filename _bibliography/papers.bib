abstract="The recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and its expanding adoption in medicine demand new approaches to ethical consideration. This is because the intersection between AI and medicine is increasingly occurring outside academic hospitals that serve as the scope for most IRBs. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the effects of systemic racism on health, as manifested by the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 disease among traditionally marginalized populations, namely, Black and Hispanic groups [Wiley, et al. J Racial Ethn Health Disparities, 2021]. This and other disparities should serve as catalysts to rethink how we build AI systems. Expanding on the ethics statement from several radiology societies in North America and Europe, we describe examples of ethical challenges on data, algorithm, and practical deployment of artificial intelligence. Thereafter we discuss strategies to mitigate this bias and provide a roadmap for future directions for the evolving ethical landscape.",
